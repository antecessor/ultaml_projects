#XGBoost
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an open-source software library which provides a gradient boosting framework for C++, Java, Python, R, and Julia. It was developed by Tianqi Chen and provides a particularly efficient implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.

##Algorithm
XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosting that uses decision trees as the base model. It is an ensemble method, which means that it combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the overall performance of the model. The decision trees in XGBoost are trained using a variant of the gradient descent algorithm called gradient boosting.

The main idea behind gradient boosting is to train a series of decision trees in a step-by-step fashion, where each tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees. This is done by using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the predicted values of the previous trees. The new tree is then trained to minimize this gradient.

##Features
Regularization: XGBoost includes a variety of regularization options, such as L1 and L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting.
Handling Missing Values: XGBoost has built-in support for handling missing values, which is often a problem in real-world datasets.
Out-of-Core Computing: XGBoost can handle very large datasets that do not fit into memory by using a technique called "out-of-core" computing.
High Flexibility: XGBoost allows users to define custom optimization objectives and evaluation criteria, enabling users to construct a highly customized model.
Parallel Processing: XGBoost supports parallel processing, which can significantly speed up the model training process.
Built-in Cross-Validation: XGBoost includes a built-in mechanism for performing cross-validation, which makes it easy to evaluate the model's performance.
##Parameters
booster: Specify the type of model to run at each iteration. It has two options: "gbtree" or "dart".
eta: The step size shrinkage used in each boosting step. This parameter determines the learning rate of the model.
max_depth: The maximum depth of a tree. Increasing this value will make the model more complex and more likely to overfit.
subsample: The fraction of observations to be selected for each tree. Lower values make the model more conservative.
colsample_bytree: The fraction of columns to be used in each tree.
objective: This parameter specifies the loss function to be minimized.
